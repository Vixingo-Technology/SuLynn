        We collect only the necessary information to provide our services,

      <h2>Data Protection</h2>
      <p>
        We implement security measures to protect your data from unauthorized

        We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted
        on this page, and continued use of our services constitutes agreement to
        the updated policy.
